If you specifically need to install Node.js version 18.17.1 and npm version 6.14.17 on your RHEL-based Linux system, you can use the Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage multiple Node.js versions. Here are the steps to do so:

Install NVM:

First, you need to install NVM, which will allow you to manage Node.js versions. Open your terminal and run the following command to download and install NVM:

bash
Copy code
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
After installing NVM, close and reopen your terminal or run the following command to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.bashrc
Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc if you're using the Zsh shell.

Install Node.js 18.17.1:

Now that NVM is installed, you can use it to install the specific version of Node.js you want. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
nvm install 18.17.1
This will download and install Node.js version 18.17.1.

Switch to Node.js 18.17.1:

To use the installed Node.js version, set it as the default:

bash
Copy code
nvm use 18.17.1
Install npm 6.14.17:

By default, NVM will install a compatible version of npm. However, if you specifically need npm version 6.14.17, you can install it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g npm@6.14.17
This will install npm version 6.14.17 globally.

Verify Versions:

You can verify that you have the correct versions installed by running:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
These commands should display Node.js version 18.17.1 and npm version 6.14.17.

Now, you have Node.js version 18.17.1 and npm version 6.14.17 installed on your system, managed through NVM.




commands:


curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 18.17.1
nvm use 18.17.1
npm install -g npm@6.14.17
node -v
npm -v
